### Osteoporosis prediction using machine learning

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, I performed <strong>EAD</strong> on a <strong>case-control dataset</strong> for osteoporosis, controlling for demographic variables such as age, gender, and ethnicity. Then I built predictive models using <strong>LR, RF, SVM, and XGB</strong>. The <strong>Gradient Boosting Classifier</strong> and <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> achieved the highest ROC scores. Even though this is a balance dataset, the variables tend to be bias towards the negative class (no-osteoporosis), meaning the <em> True Negative</em>  and <em>False Negative</em>  scores are always higher than <em>True Positive</em> and <em>False Positive</em> scores. This trend is consistent in the <em>confusion matrix</em> of the 6 ML models. </div>

### COVID-19 Vaccine adverse symptoms in VAERS with Association Rule Mining

To address <strong>vaccine hesitancy</strong> issues, I studied the adverse symptoms in <strong>COVID-19 vaccines</strong> using the <strong><em>VAERS</em></strong> data. VAERS is the public surveillance system co-manage by the CDC and FDA to detect rare vaccine adverse events. By applying <strong>association rule mining</strong>, I discovered the top <strong>adverse symptoms</strong> in COVID-19 vaccines, and compared the differences in adverse symptoms between <strong>Moderna</strong> and <strong>Pfizer vaccines</strong>.

MAUDE is the medical device passive surveillance dataset from the FDA. I built a visualization app to project the temporal trends in the harm levels using the 2016 MAUDE data.
